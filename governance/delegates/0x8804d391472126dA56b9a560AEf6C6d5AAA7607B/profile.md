**Core Value**

* Connecting the West and the East for the Maker Community
* Diversity of Ideas and Communities
* Pragmatic

**Delegate Statement**

Even before joining Maker in late 2018 to help the protocol’s expansion in Asia, especially China and Korea, I was fascinated by the Maker system and wrote guides in Korean as there was no available information in Korean.

Fast forward to 2022, as the DeFi industry and Dai usage grew rapidly, we saw the increase in interest from Asia as well. In fact, China itself accounts for the 2nd largest user base for the protocol.

However, in terms of governance and community, there is still a large disconnect between the West and the East. This is partly due to the language barrier as many use their own communication channels (Kakaotalk for Koreans for example), and most of the materials are only available in English. Moreover, many of the calls including Governance Meetings take place at 3 or 4am in Asia time. The disconnect grew larger as the Community Lead role doesn’t exist anymore after the Foundation dissolved.

Although there’s no Korea Lead, I still operate the Korean community and connect with Maker holders and users for the same passion and reason I wrote guides in Korean before joining Maker in 2018. I want more people to be interested in the Maker protocol and hear and share their feedback with the greater Maker community. This is why after many thoughts, I decided to become a delegate.

**Delegate Next Steps**

As a delegate focusing on connecting the West and the East, I will continue to communicate with various communities in Asia and reflect them in the voting. The two most common points are:

**1. Larger Presence and Contents Across Different Countries**

Currently, the Maker protocol is mainly in English and many non-English communities are declining as the strategy and management are lagging behind. They want to see more content in different languages and also more active communication.

-In accordance, I will support sound proposals that can achieve such.

**2. Aggressively increase Dai Access**

A large number of users in Asia focus on convenience and accessibility. As a result, it’s a home to some of the largest cryptocards and crypto mobile wallets in the world. They are also quite sensitive to transaction fees, which allowed the strong growth of BSC, Polygon, Klaytn, etc in the region.

-In accordance, I will support sound proposals that can achieve such. I would strongly vote against proposals that hinder the access (such as increasing minimum vault size)

**Conflicts of Interest**

Contributor to the Growth Core Unit. I help with the team’s growth in Asia.
